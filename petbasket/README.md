## Overview
PetBasket is a web application designed to help match users with their ideal pet! It's free to join, and users may search for pets in their area that are available for adoption based on type (dog or cat), age, and gender. It also features a Classifieds/Listings feature where users can upload a photo and information of pet(s) they have available for adoption.

## Wild Card Route/Global Variable
```
router.all("/*", (req,res,next)=>{
	if(req.session.uid == undefined){
		console.log("you are not loggedin");
		next();
	}else if(req.session.uid != undefined){
		console.log("YOU ARE LOGGEDIN");
		res.locals.firstNameTest = req.session.fname;
		res.locals.lastNameTest = req.session.lname;
		res.locals.emailTest = req.session.email;
		res.locals.profileimgTest = req.session.profileimg;
		res.locals.uidTest = req.session.uid;

		next();
	}
});
```
## 3 Contributions Weâ€™d Like to See
1. Allow users to search by pet microchip, vaccination, and temperament status
2. Combine both uploads table and pets table in our own database
3. Auto update our database from RescueGroups
4. Refactor our code to make use of functions correctly
5. Need to loop through upload to get pictures
